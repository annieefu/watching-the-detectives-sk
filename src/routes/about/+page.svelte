              This project was born on an early morning in September 2023, after
              we (Annie Fu and Dana Gong) watched the incredible movie that is
              Watching the Detectives. We finished it around 3am, delirious from
              constant laughter and bewildered at what we had just seen. We loved
              it. We didn't understand how the movie didn't have a cult following.
              We were determined to kickstart said cult following on our own. Over
              the next few months, we fleshed out the idea for this fansite and
              worked on it here and there, forming a consistent throughline for
              our friendship.

              Dana passed away in the summer of 2024, before we could finish the
              site.
